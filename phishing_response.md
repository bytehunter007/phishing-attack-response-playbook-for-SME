## SME-Playbook: Enhanced Phishing Attack Response

Note: This playbook is designed to be a starting point and may require customisation based on your specific organisation and security needs.

### 1. Preemptive Measures

 Employee Training:
   Conduct regular phishing awareness training to educate employees about common phishing tactics and how to identify suspicious emails.
   Provide examples of real-world phishing attacks and discuss best practices for avoiding them.
 Email Filtering:
   Implement advanced email filtering solutions to block known phishing emails before they reach employee inboxes.
   Consider using AI-powered filtering to detect more sophisticated phishing attempts.
 Security Awareness Campaigns:
   Run ongoing campaigns to promote a culture of security awareness and encourage employees to report suspicious activity.
   Use gamification or incentives to motivate participation.

### 2. Incident Response

 Immediate Action:
   If a phishing email is suspected, isolate the affected device from the network to prevent further compromise.
   Disable the user's account to limit potential damage.
 Password Reset:
   Require users to reset passwords for any accounts that may have been compromised.
   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
 Incident Investigation:
   Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the breach and identify any compromised systems or data.
   Use digital forensics tools to analyse compromised systems and recover any lost or stolen data.
 Threat Intelligence:
   Leverage threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about current phishing campaigns and emerging threats.
   Subscribe to reputable threat intelligence providers.
 Digital Forensics:
   If necessary, engage digital forensics experts to analyze compromised systems and recover any lost or stolen data.

### 3. Post-Incident Activities

 Patch Management:
   Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by phishing attacks.
   Automate patch management processes to reduce the risk of unpatched systems.
 Security Review:
   Conduct a comprehensive review of security policies and procedures to identify areas for improvement and prevent future incidents.
   Update your incident response plan based on the lessons learned from the incident.
 Employee Education:
   Reinforce phishing awareness training to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
   Provide employees with additional resources and guidance on how to avoid phishing attacks.

### 4. Advanced Techniques

 Phishing Simulation Drills:
   Conduct regular phishing simulation drills to test employees' ability to identify and respond to phishing attacks.
   Analyse the results of the drills to identify areas for improvement in employee training and awareness.
 Behavioral Analytics:
   Implement behavioral analytics solutions to detect unusual user activity that may indicate a phishing compromise.
   Monitor for suspicious login attempts, unusual file downloads, or other anomalous behavior.
 Dark Web Monitoring:
   Monitor the dark web for any leaked credentials or sensitive data associated with your organization.
   Use specialised tools to detect and track leaked information.
 Threat Hunting:
   Employ threat hunting techniques to proactively identify and investigate potential phishing attacks before they can cause significant harm.
   Use advanced analytics and threat intelligence to detect unusual activity.

### 5. Emerging Threats

 BEC Attacks:
   Be aware of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, where attackers impersonate high-level executives to trick employees into transferring funds or sharing sensitive information.
   Implement controls to verify the authenticity of unusual requests, such as requiring additional approvals or using out-of-band verification methods.
 Spear Phishing:
   Protect against spear phishing attacks, which target specific individuals or organizations with highly personalised emails.
   Educate employees about the risks of clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown senders.
 Smishing and Vishing:
   Guard against smishing (SMS phishing) and vishing (voice phishing) attacks that leverage SMS messages or phone calls to trick victims.
   Implement security measures to protect against unauthorized access to mobile devices and phone systems.

Note: This playbook can be further customized and expanded based on your organisation's specific needs and industry best practices. Consider consulting with a security expert to ensure that your playbook is aligned with your security goals and regulatory requirements.
